# Vision Tower

**Empowering Existing CCTV Network with AI/ML for Crowd Control, Crime Prevention, and Security Monitoring.**

## 🚀 Overview
Vision Tower is an AI-powered surveillance system designed to enhance security monitoring using existing CCTV infrastructure. It leverages machine learning for real-time crowd analysis, anomaly detection, and crime prevention.

## 🔹 Features
- **Crowd Monitoring**: Detects unusual crowd behavior and density.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious activities using AI models.
- **Security Alerts**: Sends real-time notifications for detected threats.
- **Dataset-Driven**: Utilizes pre-trained AI models with relevant datasets.
- **Flask Backend**: Manages API requests and processes detections.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (for backend processing)
- **OpenCV** (for video analysis)
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)
- **Machine Learning Models** (for detection and classification)
- **Pygame & Playsound** (for audio alerts)

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisionTower.git
   cd VisionTower
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 📌 Usage
